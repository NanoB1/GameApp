# GameApp
The client “The Gaming Room” goal was to increase the targeted users for their game “Draw it or Lose it” by enabling the game to support cross-platform. The game would be able to be played by multiple operating systems in the website using a client server architecture. The section I think I did well in my documentation was the “Recommendation”. The important aspect of the design document was following by step-by-step for the project infrastructure of the development. The document provides a general insight to others of the application without needing to look in code. The part I felt I still needed to work on would be the advantage/disadvantage of each platform. There’s still lot more in technical detail in different areas that need to be considered. To interpret my user needs, I evaluated of what game functions is needed for the game application from the company and then there’s the technical part of performance, security, and reliability. Analyzing the user needs and the system specs, pursue the steps for development. Techniques provided and used in the documentation provides beneficial in the software development. With this it provides back bone for the development and can be built to improve on for the future uses.
